### Change of Statutes and the Pirate Manifesto and Decision-making-Process

Abstentions will not be taken into account.
##### Article 25 – Change of Statutes
(1) Proposals must be presented in writing by any means (electronic, paper or  otherwise) to the Board which will transmit them to the Members of the Council for deliberation at least four weeks prior to the meeting at which the Council will deliberate and decide on those  proposals. The proposed amendments to the Articles of Association must  be attached to the notice calling the meeting of the Council. A  reference to a website displaying the proposed changes of the Statutes would also be sufficient.

(2) Decisions regarding amendments to the Statutes can only be taken if there is an attendance quota of two-thirds of the members entitled to vote present or represented and shall be taken with a double majority of two-thirds of the votes cast by two-thirds of the Ordinary Members taking part in the voting, except for decisions on the Principles (Art. 4) and Objectives (Art. 5) where consent of all the Ordinary Council Members is necessary.

(3) Any decision amending the Statutes shall be submitted to the Belgian Minister of Justice and published in the Annexes to the Belgian Official Gazette.

(4) Except in the event of judicial dissolution and automatic dissolution due to the requirements of the law, the association may be prematurely  dissolved only by a decision of the Council acting in accordance with  Article 20 of the Law on Not-for-profit Associations.

(5) It may be dissoluted by a four-fifth majority decision of the Council with an attendance quota of two-thirds of the members entitled to vote  present or represented. If the quota is not reached, a new meeting of the Council shall be called no earlier than 15 calendar days after the first meeting. The second meeting of the Council shall be entitled to take valid decisions irrespective of the number of members with voting rights present or represented.

(6) As from the moment the decision of dissolution is taken, the Association  is required to mention at all times that it is ‘in dissolution’.
