### Change of Statutes and the Pirate Manifesto and Decision-making-Process
##### Article 24 - Decision-making-Process
(1) If not otherwise specified in these Statutes, all decisions taken by the Council or the Board will be decided by a simple majority of the votes cast.

(2) All votes will be public and published in the minutes of a meeting, including those for elections. They shall be done in writing, if appropriate.

Abstentions will not be taken into account.
##### Article 25 – Change of Statutes
(1) Proposals must be presented in writing by any means (electronic, paper or  otherwise) to the Board which will transmit them to the Members of the Council for deliberation at least four weeks prior to the meeting at which the Council will deliberate and decide on those  proposals. The proposed amendments to the Articles of Association must  be attached to the notice calling the meeting of the Council. A  reference to a website displaying the proposed changes of the Statutes would also be sufficient.

(2) Decisions regarding amendments to the Statutes can only be taken if there is an attendance quota of two-thirds of the members entitled to vote present or represented and shall be taken with a double majority of two-thirds of the votes cast by two-thirds of the Ordinary Members taking part in the voting, except for decisions on the Principles (Art. 4) and Objectives (Art. 5) where consent of all the Ordinary Council Members is necessary.

(3) Any decision amending the Statutes shall be submitted to the Company Registrar (RCSL) and published according to the law.

##### Art. 26 – Change of the Pirate Manifesto
(1) The Pirate Manifesto combines the identified common policies of the member parties in a document representing the common policies of the Association and is an integral part of these Statutes.

The second meeting of the Council shall be entitled to take valid decisions irrespective of the number of members with voting rights present or represented.

(6) As from the moment the decision of dissolution is taken, the Association  is required to mention at all times that it is ‘in dissolution’.

(7) In the event that the Association is dissolved, the Council shall decide  by a simple majority of the votes cast on

* b) the methods and procedures for the liquidation of the Association and
* c) the destination to be given to the net assets of the Association. The net assets of the  Association will have to be allocated to a non-profit purpose. They may be divided among the member parties according to their financial contributions.
